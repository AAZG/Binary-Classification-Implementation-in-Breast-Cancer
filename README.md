# Binary Classification Implementation in Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Data Set

Features are computed from a digitized image of a fine needle aspirate (FNA) of a breast mass. They describe characteristics of the cell nuclei present in the image. n the 3-dimensional space is that described in: [K. P. Bennett and O. L. Mangasarian: "Robust Linear Programming Discrimination of Two Linearly Inseparable Sets", Optimization Methods and Software 1, 1992, 23-34].

## Motivation.
Learn and practice within the branch of data science.


## Problem it solves.
Need to carry out a classification to determine the Diagnosis of mammary tissues of future patients with tumors.

## Completed.
- Data cleaning and Data preprocessing
- EDA: Univariate and multivariate analysis
- Scaling Data
- Creacion de pipeline para balancear data (SMOTE), disminucion de dimensionalidad (PCA) y modelo Binary Classification.
- Classification with LogisticRegression, GaussianNaiveBayes, DecisionTreeClassifier, RandomForestClassifier, KNeighborsClassifier, SupportVectorMachine, BaggingClassifier, BoostingDecisionTree and VotingClassifier

## Characteristics.
* The project was done in a jupyter labs notebook.
* Within the project there are observations as the analysis progresses.
* You can interact with many of the charts since the Plotly library was used.


## Participants.
The project was carried out individually.
